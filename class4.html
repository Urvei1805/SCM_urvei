        <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. 
            Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:
             A paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc.
              In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
              Various educators teach rules governing the length of paragraphs. They may say that a paragraph should be 100 to 200 words long, or be no more than five or six sentences. 
              But a good paragraph should not be measured in characters, words, or sentences
